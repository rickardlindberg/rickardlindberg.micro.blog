			 <p>This month I read <a href="https://www.kathleenspracklen.com/zettelkasten-emotion">How to Use a Zettelkasten to Write Stories Packed with
Emotion</a>. It inspired
me to write something using that technique. The topic that came to mind was
Bash redirects. It resulted in the blog post <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/09/04/bash-redirects-explained.html">Bash Redirects
Explained</a>.</p>
<p>I also started reading <em>How Children Learn</em> by John Holt. He says that children
are naturally interested in exploring the world. I started thinking about what
environments kill exploration. I though that fear of doing something wrong will
discourage exploration. Then I made a parallel to a common practice in software
development: pull requests. I thought that pull requests discourage experiments
because changes can only propagate after approval, and the idea behind pull
requests is to only approve &ldquo;good&rdquo; changes. First of all, the learning
opportunities of mistakes are gone. Second of all, you might loose interest in
experimenting because you are afraid of making a mistake. You build a culture
of discouraging making mistakes. I though that a better approach is to focus on
making the cost of mistakes small so that we can do lots of them and learn from
them.</p>
<p>I also read <a href="https://www.debuggingteams.com/">Debugging Teams</a> by Ben
Collins-Sussman and Brian Fitzpatrick. They talk about the myth of the genius
programmer and that all great things are built by teams. I believe that is
true, but sometimes I have a hard time to acknowledge it because I also enjoy
working by myself.</p>

			 <p>I thought I knew how Bash redirects worked.</p>
<p>If I wanted to redirect the output of a command to a file, I&rsquo;d type this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">program &gt; /tmp/log.txt
</code></pre></div><p>If I wanted to pipe both stdout and stderr to a text editor for further
processing, I&rsquo;d type this:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>I knew that <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> meant redirect stderr to stdout making it appear on stdout
as well.</p>
<p>I knew certain patterns for certain situations. But when I encountered
situations where I had not learned a pattern, I was lost. For example, I could
not explain the difference between</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">program 2&gt;&amp;<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> &gt;/tmp/log.txt
</code></pre></div><p>and</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">program &gt;/tmp/log.txt 2&gt;&amp;<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And I got scared when I saw something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">program &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt 2&gt;&amp;<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Have you also been there? What did you do?</p>
<p>I would search the Internet for a pattern that matched the use case, or just
try different alternatives and notice how they behaved.</p>
<p>I did this until one day when I learned a mental model for how Bash redirects
work. Now I no longer need to rely on patterns. I can easily parse any
situation and use any combination of redirects for my purposes.</p>
<p>The rest of this article explains this mental model.</p>
<h2 id="the-standard-streams">The Standard Streams</h2>
<p>A process has three standard streams attached to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin (0)</li>
<li>stdout (1)</li>
<li>stderr (2)</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When we start a program from the terminal, Bash sets up the standard streams as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin: terminal/keyboard</li>
<li>stdout: terminal</li>
<li>stderr: terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>What redirects do is to modify what the standard streams point to before the
program starts executing.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;</code> means modify stdin.</li>
<li><code>&gt;</code> means modify stdout.</li>
<li><code>2&gt;</code> means modify stderr.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is the mental model: <strong>redirects modify standard streams before program
execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s evaluate a few examples using this mental model to see how it works.</p>
<h2 id="logcat-utility">Logcat Utility</h2>
<p>To be able to show what happens in different examples, we have a utility
program, <code>logcat.py</code>, that makes use of all three streams. It reads text from
stdin, logs the arguments and the length of the text to stderr, and writes the
text to stdout. It looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>

sys<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>stdout<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>write(text)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="example-no-redirect">Example: No Redirect</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an example without redirects to see the operation of
<code>logcat.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./logcat.py ignored arguments
</code></pre></div><p>Before <code>logcat.py</code> starts executing, Bash sets up the standard streams as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin: terminal/keyboard</li>
<li>stdout: terminal</li>
<li>stderr: terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>When execution starts, <code>logcat.py</code> waits for input. If we type <code>hello</code> in the
terminal (followed by a return and ctrl+d), the following is printed to the
terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Args: [&#39;ignored&#39;, &#39;arguments&#39;]
Read 6 characters.
hello
</code></pre></div><p>We can see that it read our input from the terminal/keyboard and wrote the log
messages along with our input to the terminal as well.</p>
<h2 id="example-redirect-stdin">Example: Redirect Stdin</h2>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s modify stdin to instead of the terminal/keyboard be the <code>logcat.py</code>
source code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./logcat.py ignored arguments &lt;logcat.py
</code></pre></div><p>This instructs Bash to modify stdin to point to the file <code>logcat.py</code>.</p>
<p>Before <code>logcat.py</code> starts executing, Bash sets up the standard streams as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>
<li>stdout: terminal</li>
<li>stderr: terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>When execution starts, the following is printed to the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Args: [&#39;ignored&#39;, &#39;arguments&#39;]
Read 182 characters.
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys

text = sys.stdin.read()

sys.stderr.write(f&#34;Args: {(sys.argv[1:])}\n&#34;)
sys.stderr.write(f&#34;Read {len(text)} characters.\n&#34;)

sys.stdout.write(text)
</code></pre></div><p>We can see that the redirect operation is stripped from the arguments. Only
Bash sees it and does not pass it along to the program. Furthermore we can see
that the <code>logcat.py</code> source code is printed to the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="example-redirect-stdin-and-stdout">Example: Redirect Stdin and Stdout</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re only interested in the log messages, and want to throw away
stdout:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./logcat.py ignored arguments &lt;logcat.py &gt;/dev/null
</code></pre></div><p>This instructs Bash to modify stdin to point to the file <code>logcat.py</code> and to
modify stdout to point to the file <code>/dev/null</code>.</p>
<p>Before <code>logcat.py</code> starts executing, Bash sets up the standard streams as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>
<li>stdout: <code>/dev/null</code> (opened in write mode)</li>
<li>stderr: terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>When execution starts, the following is printed to the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Args: [&#39;ignored&#39;, &#39;arguments&#39;]
Read 182 characters.
</code></pre></div><p>We can see that the redirect operations are all stripped from the arguments and
the source code has been written to <code>/dev/null</code> and is thus not shown in the
terminal.</p>
<h2 id="extended-mental-model">Extended Mental Model</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s extended the mental model to clarify how Bash operates.</p>
<p>When Bash parses a command, it divides it into two parts: the arguments and the
redirects. Before it starts executing the program with the arguments, it goes
through the redirects, in order, and configures the standard streams before
execution.</p>
<h2 id="example-redirect-all-streams">Example: Redirect All Streams</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how we can interpret a more complex command using the extended mental
model:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./logcat.py &lt;logcat.py is the &gt;out.txt best 2&gt;&amp;1 thing
</code></pre></div><p>If we split this into arguments and redirects, we get this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments: <code>./logcat.py</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>the</code>, <code>best</code>, <code>thing</code></li>
<li>Redirects: <code>&lt;logcat.py</code>, <code>&gt;out.txt</code>, <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s evaluate the redirects in order. The state of the standard streams
at start is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin: terminal/keyboard</li>
<li>stdout: terminal</li>
<li>stderr: terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we evaluate <code>&lt;logcat.py</code> and get this:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>
<li>stdout: terminal</li>
<li>stderr: terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we evaluate <code>&gt;out.txt</code> and get this:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>
<li>stdout: <code>out.txt</code> (opened in write mode)</li>
<li>stderr: terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we evaluate <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code>, which means modify stderr (<code>2&gt;</code>) to be whatever
stdout points to (<code>&amp;1</code>), and get this:</p>
<ul>
<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>
<li>stdout: <code>out.txt</code> (opened in write mode)</li>
<li>stderr: <code>out.txt</code> (opened in write mode)</li>
</ul>
<p>After the standard streams have been set up, execution of <code>./logcat.py is the best thing</code> starts. Nothing appears on the terminal since all output has been
redirected to <code>out.txt</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ cat out.txt
Args: [&#39;is&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;best&#39;, &#39;thing&#39;]
Read 182 characters.
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys

text = sys.stdin.read()

sys.stderr.write(f&#34;Args: {(sys.argv[1:])}\n&#34;)
sys.stderr.write(f&#34;Read {len(text)} characters.\n&#34;)

sys.stdout.write(text)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="mini-shell">Mini Shell</h2>
<p>I created a mini version of a shell to demonstrate how straight forward it is
to implement redirects with POSIX system calls. It works exactly as the
extended mental model, and because it is running software, it fills in some
more details of the model. I would guess that Bash does something similar even
though I haven&rsquo;t read its source code.</p>
<p>First off, here is a demo that shows how the mini shell can replicate the
complex example from above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./minishell.py
~~?~~&gt; ./logcat.py &lt;logcat.py is the &gt;out.txt best 2&gt;&amp;1 thing
~~0~~&gt; cat out.txt
Args: [&#39;is&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;best&#39;, &#39;thing&#39;]
Read 182 characters.
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys

text = sys.stdin.read()

sys.stderr.write(f&#34;Args: {(sys.argv[1:])}\n&#34;)
sys.stderr.write(f&#34;Read {len(text)} characters.\n&#34;)

sys.stdout.write(text)
</code></pre></div><p>And here is the implementation in only 31 lines of Python:</p>

how Bash operates. Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p>
<h2 id="example-duplicated-files">Example: Duplicated Files</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can explain the difference between the following commands using
the mini shell for the model:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./logcat.py &lt;logcat.py &gt;out.txt 2&gt;out.txt
$ ./logcat.py &lt;logcat.py &gt;out.txt 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre></div><p>At a first glance, it looks like both commands redirect both stdout and stderr
to the <code>out.txt</code> file. But if we evaluate it like mini shell does, we see that
the first example will open the file twice (two calls to <code>os.open</code> creating two
file handles), whereas the second example will open the file only once and then
duplicate the file handle for stderr.</p>
<p>When two file handles are created, writes to the two streams will attempt to
write to the same location in the file and they will overwrite each other.
Furthermore, buffering might alter in which order writes happen, so it is not
clear what will actually end up in the file. So to make sure all output is
captured in the file, the second example should be used where the file is only
opened once.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is still more to Bash redirects than what I have explained here. But this
mental model (along with its extended versions) have helped me reason about
Bash redirects. I hope it will do the same for you.</p>

want to improve my note taking tool, I did some programming on hobby projects,
and I migrated my blog to a new platform. All while doing many runs.</p>

<h2 id="a-system-for-writing">A System for Writing</h2>
<p>I read <em>A System for Writing</em> by Bob Doto. <a href="http://richardcarter.com/reviews/book-review-a-system-for-writing-by-bob-doto/">This
review</a>
is what made me buy the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I first tried to get my head around Zettelkasten, I consulted Sönke
Ahrens’ extremely useful book How to Take Smart Notes. This was—and still
is—seen as the book to read on the subject. I predict A System for Writing
will replace it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked Sönke&rsquo;s book, and I was curious to learn more about this topic from a
source that seemed credible.</p>
<p>I got some new insights about the Zettelkasten method. In particular the idea
that it is important to articulate how two ideas relate. I&rsquo;ve previously mostly
connected ideas without context. The connection was obvious when I made it,
but most likely less obvious when I come back to it.</p>
<p>I tried to research this a bit more and found the article <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/">Backlinking Is Not
Very Useful &ndash; Often Even
Harmful</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good link context explains what you can expect if you follow the link. But
it can also explain the nature of the relationship between both notes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to try this out.</p>
<h2 id="smart-notes">Smart Notes</h2>
<p>I use my <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/categories/smart-notes">Smart Notes</a> app
to take notes using the Zettelkasten method. When I studied the method more, I
got some new ideas that I implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I configured different note types to show in different colors. Zettelkasten
has a few different kinds of notes, and quickly being able to see, by color,
which it is, has been helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I added the ability to change the order of notes. This was needed to be able
to create structure notes with links in specific order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I added the ability to give <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/08/11/i-just-implemented.html">links a text
description</a>.
This is what allowed me to experiment with articulating how two ideas relate
to each other. I wrote more about the evolution of this feature in <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/08/29/linking-and-how.html">Linking
(and how it has evolved) in Smart
Notes</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="one-file-programs">One-File Programs</h2>
<p>I continued to work on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/one-file-programs">One-File
Programs</a>.</p>
<p>I worked on an engine app that can automatically reload other apps when they
change. This gives faster feedback, especially when working on graphical
applications. It is similar to an approach I&rsquo;ve written about previously in
<a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/2023/07/28/how-to-get.html">How to get fast feedback on graphical
code?</a></p>
<p>I also worked on the <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/one-file-programs/tree/master/no-scrollbars">no
scrollbars</a>
app. I wanted to see if we can get rid of scrollbars in some GUI elements. The
idea is to make items larger around the area of the mouse so that they can more
easily get selected. Here is one screenshot:</p>

<p>I want do continue work with this repo, but the rest of the time this month, I
spent on my blog.</p>
<h2 id="microblog">Micro.blog</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/08/11/how-i-found.html">found out about
Micro.blog</a> and moved
my blog to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I documented how I did a redirect to my old archived site for pages that I
have not yet migrated to the new blog in <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/08/09/poor-mans-redirect.html">Poor man&rsquo;s redirect in a static

improves from them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some reflections on Micro.blog:</p>

<li>
<p>Micro.blog makes it easy to create <a href="https://nicochilla.com/my-website-as-a-home/">a website that feels like a

			 <p>I created Smart Notes to be a digital note taking application that follows
principles from the Zettelkasten method, as explained in Sönke Ahren&rsquo;s book
<em>How to Take Smart Notes</em>.</p>
<p>Two fundamental aspects of the Zettelkasten method are notes and links between
them.</p>
<p>In a physical Zettelkasten, notes are written on index cards (or some similar
format), given unique, hierarchical ids, and stored sequentially in a slip-box:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Sönke writes that you should add a new note to the slip-box directly behind the
note you are referring to. That creates one kind of link. He also writes that
you can add it behind multiple notes by by referring to its unique in other
notes.</p>
<p>Here is how I realized this aspect of the Zettelkasten method in Smart Notes:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Some design decisions and my reasoning about them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notes are visualized as a physical index cards. That restricts the amount of
text that you can write on them. I felt like a problem with a digital
approach might be that you write too much on your notes because there is
unlimited space. I was also interested in mimicking the feeling of working
with physical index cards on a table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Links are visualized as strings between notes. You can link however you want.
In the above example, the note related to both notes are added behind both
the first note and the note that is related to the first note. (The note is
shown twice, but it is the same note.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note ids are not shown in the UI. In a physical Zettelkasten, note ids are
important to be able to find a note when following a link. (If a note says
&ldquo;see note X&rdquo; you need to be able to locate X in the slip-box.) But in
Smart Notes the link is right there and shows the note that it links to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trains-of-thought-and-branches">Trains of thought and branches</h2>
<p>Another aspect of the Zettelkasten method is trains of though. Notes related to
each other can form a train of thought, and reviewing that train of though is
useful. In a physical Zettelkasten related notes are stored close to each
other, and following a train of though can be done by flipping through the
cards in an area.</p>
<p>I was thinking about how this aspect of Zettelkasten could be realized in Smart
Notes.</p>
<p>I read more about how notes are stored and numbered in a physical Zettelkasten.
There seems to be two cases. Either the note is related to an existing note, in
which case it is put right behind it, or the note is not related to any
existing notes, in which case it is put at the end.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a note is related to an existing note, a distinction seems to
be made if the new note continues the train of though of the previous note or
if it branches off. With the Zettelkasten numbering system, it might be
possible to distinguish these different cases. In <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/">Introduction to the
Zettelkasten Method</a>, Sascha writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very first note is assigned the number 1. If you add a second note that
is not related to the first note, it is assigned the number 2. But if you
want to continue the first note, or inject something into its content,
comment on it, or something along those lines, you branch off. That new note
would get assigned the number 1a. If you continue with this new note, you
would go on with 1b. If you then want to comment on the note 1a, you would
create a note with the address 1a1. So, in short, whenever you continue a
train of thought, you increment the last position in the address, be it
number or a character from the alphabet. And when you want to expand,
intersperse, or comment on a note, you take its address and append a new
character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smart Note lacks any visible note ids. So I was thinking that I might be
missing out on something. What types of hierarchies are created with the
numbering scheme in Zettelkasten? Can I already replicate those hierarchies in
Smart Notes?</p>
<h2 id="folgezettel">Folgezettel</h2>
<p>There seems to be a debate going on whether the numbering scheme in
Zettelkasten, sometimes called &ldquo;folgezettel&rdquo; is useful or not.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/">No, Luhmann was not about
Folgezettel</a>, Sascha
argues that the kind of links created with folgezettel are weak. We know that
there is a relationship between two notes, but we don&rsquo;t know what that
relationship is. Sascha further acknowledges that the folgezettel technique is
probably more practically useful in a physical Zettelkasten, but in a digital
world, creating annotated links is a better solution. (Creating annotated links
is certainly possible in a physical Zettelkasten, but browsing those links
would be tedious because the note in the link might be in a totally different
place in the slip-box.)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://writing.bobdoto.computer/folgezettel-is-more-than-mechanism/">Folgezettel is More than
Mechanism</a>,
Bob argues that the folgezettel technique is useful even in a digital world.
One point is that it allows you to get a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the topics and
threads that are developing in your Zettelkasten. Another point is that it
forces you to think about note relationships when you add notes to the
slip-box.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think that the mechanism of folgezettel is just about creating
hierarchies of notes. That&rsquo;s certainly possible already in Smart Notes.
Perhaps the numbering scheme is not essential to the Zettelkasten method?
Perhaps I should explore annotated links more instead?</p>
<h2 id="annotated-links">Annotated links</h2>
<p>Sascha&rsquo;s point about annotated links and their importance got me thinking how
to apply it to Smart Notes. (In <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/">Backlinking Is Not Very Useful &ndash; Often Even
Harmful</a>, Sascha talks
more about the importance of adding context to links.)</p>
<p>Here is one thought I had about it early on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An unclear link between two notes can be clarified by inserting a note in
between that explains the reason for the link. <code>A -&gt; B</code> can become <code>A -&gt; explanation -&gt; B</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years later, I tried this out. It looked like this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I found that the &ldquo;explanation note&rdquo; took up much space and made it more
difficult to navigate the note network. That&rsquo;s when I decided that Smart Notes
needed the ability to annotate links instead. Here is how it turned out:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only experimented with this a little, but I find that navigation is
easier. My hope is that short &ldquo;linking phrases&rdquo; (inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map">concept
mapping</a>) will be enough to annotate
links.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>With annotated links added, I think Smart Notes is pretty flexible. First of
all you can create arbitrary tree-like structures that can mimic the structure
you get from folgezettel without having to deal with a complicated numbering
scheme. That structure can give you a bird&rsquo;s eye view that Bob talks about. If
you don&rsquo;t want to emphasize a tree structure, you can use annotated links to
link arbitrarily and make the context of the connections clear.</p>
<p>I try to make Smart Notes a digital note taking application that follows
principles from the Zettelkasten method. Sometimes it is easy to focus on the
specifics of the method and try to replicate it as closely as possible. But I
think it is more important to experiment and see what works. Smart Notes has
been my way of exploring Zettelkasten, and I will continue to tweak it as I
learn, both from reading and researching, and from practicing. Most
importantly, I will try to use my notes for creative output and learning and
try to notice what features in Smart Notes maximize that.</p>

tell, there is no way on Micro.blog to easily configure many redirects. (You
have to to it manually one by one, which is tedious for hundreds of URLs.)</p>
<p>Then I came across <a href="https://dahlstrand.net/">Sven Dahlstrand&rsquo;s</a> blog, which is
also hosted on Micro.blog. When I tried visiting a <a href="https://dahlstrand.net/not-found-test">page that did not
exist</a>, I saw this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That got me thinking that I could provide a textual explanation that the page
has not yet been migrated on my 404 error page. (You can customize the 404
error page on Micro.blog.)</p>
<p>But, how is this possible? Micro.blog hosts static sites, and there is no way
for a static site to render dynamic HTML depending on the URL.</p>
<p>Then I did what I first did when I learned to program 20+ years ago: I hit
&ldquo;View Page Source&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I realized that the dynamic part was rendered with Javascript:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;Sorry, &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">span</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;this-page-text&#34;</span>&gt;this page&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">span</span>&gt; could not be found. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you didn&amp;rsquo;t break the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s probably my fault. 😅&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>I was confused by <code>&lt;script module&gt;</code> and the backtick syntax. Most likely
Javascript has changed a bit since I last worked with it.</p>
<p>I put together something similar, with more familiar Javascript, for my 404
error page:</p>

Micro.blog Markdown processing will turn the link in the &ldquo;a-body&rdquo; into another
link tag so we end up with nested links which makes the Javascript not work.)</p>
<p>Thank you <a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a> for showing me that this was possible, and for making me re-live
the experience of first learning to program. I wish more environments had a
&ldquo;View Page Source&rdquo; function.</p>
