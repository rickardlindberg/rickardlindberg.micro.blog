				"content_html": "<p>I created Smart Notes to be a digital note taking application that followsprinciples from the Zettelkasten method, as explained in Sönke Ahren&rsquo;s book<em>How to Take Smart Notes</em>.Two fundamental aspects of the Zettelkasten method are notes and links betweenthem.In a physical Zettelkasten, notes are written on index cards (or some similarformat), given unique, hierarchical ids, and stored sequentially in a slip-box:&lt;img src=&ldquo;uploads/2024/physical-zettelkasten.png&quot;width=&ldquo;600&rdquo; height=&ldquo;458&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;Illustration of physical Zettelkasten.&quot;&gt;Sönke writes that you should add a new note to the slip-box directly behind thenote you are referring to. That creates one kind of link. He also writes thatyou can add it behind multiple notes by by referring to its unique in othernotes.Here is how I realized this aspect of the Zettelkasten method in Smart Notes:&lt;img src=&ldquo;uploads/2024/smart-notes-links.png&quot;width=&ldquo;600&rdquo; height=&ldquo;337&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;Screenshot of Smart Notes showing how notes andlinks are represented.&quot;&gt;Some design decisions and my reasoning about them:* Notes are visualized as a physical index cards. That restricts the amount of  text that you can write on them. I felt like a problem with a digital  approach might be that you write too much on your notes because there is  unlimited space. I was also interested in mimicking the feeling of working  with physical index cards on a table.* Links are visualized as strings between notes. You can link however you want.  In the above example, the note related to both notes are added behind both  the first note and the note that is related to the first note. (The note is  shown twice, but it is the same note.)* Note ids are not shown in the UI. In a physical Zettelkasten, note ids are  important to be able to find a note when following a link. (If a note says  &ldquo;see note X&rdquo; you need to be able to locate X in the slip-box.) But in  Smart Notes the link is right there and shows the note that it links to.## Trains of thought and branchesAnother aspect of the Zettelkasten method is trains of though. Notes related toeach other can form a train of thought, and reviewing that train of though isuseful. In a physical Zettelkasten related notes are stored close to eachother, and following a train of though can be done by flipping through thecards in an area.I was thinking about how this aspect of Zettelkasten could be realized in SmartNotes.I read more about how notes are stored and numbered in a physical Zettelkasten.There seems to be two cases. Either the note is related to an existing note, inwhich case it is put right behind it, or the note is not related to anyexisting notes, in which case it is put at the end.Furthermore, if a note is related to an existing note, a distinction seems tobe made if the new note continues the train of though of the previous note orif it branches off. With the Zettelkasten numbering system, it might bepossible to distinguish these different cases. In <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/\">Introduction to theZettelkasten Method</a>, Sascha writes:&gt; The very first note is assigned the number 1. If you add a second note that&gt; is not related to the first note, it is assigned the number 2. But if you&gt; want to continue the first note, or inject something into its content,&gt; comment on it, or something along those lines, you branch off. That new note&gt; would get assigned the number 1a. If you continue with this new note, you&gt; would go on with 1b. If you then want to comment on the note 1a, you would&gt; create a note with the address 1a1. So, in short, whenever you continue a&gt; train of thought, you increment the last position in the address, be it&gt; number or a character from the alphabet. And when you want to expand,&gt; intersperse, or comment on a note, you take its address and append a new&gt; character.Smart Note lacks any visible note ids. So I was thinking that I might bemissing out on something. What types of hierarchies are created with thenumbering scheme in Zettelkasten? Can I already replicate those hierarchies inSmart Notes?## FolgezettelThere seems to be a debate going on whether the numbering scheme inZettelkasten, sometimes called &ldquo;folgezettel&rdquo; is useful or not.In <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/\">No, Luhmann was not aboutFolgezettel</a>, Saschaargues that the kind of links created with folgezettel are weak. We know thatthere is a relationship between two notes, but we don&rsquo;t know what thatrelationship is. Sascha further acknowledges that the folgezettel technique isprobably more practically useful in a physical Zettelkasten, but in a digitalworld, creating annotated links is a better solution. (Creating annotated linksis certainly possible in a physical Zettelkasten, but browsing those linkswould be tedious because the note in the link might be in a totally differentplace in the slip-box.)In <a href=\"https://writing.bobdoto.computer/folgezettel-is-more-than-mechanism/\">Folgezettel is More thanMechanism</a>,Bob argues that the folgezettel technique is useful even in a digital world.One point is that it allows you to get a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the topics andthreads that are developing in your Zettelkasten. Another point is that itforces you to think about note relationships when you add notes to theslip-box.I&rsquo;m starting to think that the mechanism of folgezettel is just about creatinghierarchies of notes. That&rsquo;s certainly possible already in Smart Notes.Perhaps the numbering scheme is not essential to the Zettelkasten method?Perhaps I should explore annotated links more instead?## Annotated linksSascha&rsquo;s point about annotated links and their importance got me thinking howto apply it to Smart Notes. (In <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/\">Backlinking Is Not Very Useful &ndash; Often EvenHarmful</a>, Sascha talksmore about the importance of adding context to links.)Here is one thought I had about it early on:&gt; An unclear link between two notes can be clarified by inserting a note in&gt; between that explains the reason for the link. <code>A -&gt; B</code> can become <code>A -&gt;&gt; explanation -&gt; B</code>.Many years later, I tried this out. It looked like this:&lt;img src=&ldquo;uploads/2024/smart-notes-link-note.png&quot;width=&ldquo;600&rdquo; height=&ldquo;345&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;Screenshot of Smart Notes showing the use of alink note.&quot;&gt;I found that the &ldquo;explanation note&rdquo; took up much space and made it moredifficult to navigate the note network. That&rsquo;s when I decided that Smart Notesneeded the ability to annotate links instead. Here is how it turned out:&lt;imgsrc=&ldquo;<a href=\"https://rickardlindberg.me/uploads/2024/smart-notes-link-annotation.png%22width=%22600%22\">https://rickardlindberg.me/uploads/2024/smart-notes-link-annotation.png&quot;width=&quot;600&quot;</a> height=&ldquo;345&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;Screenshot of Smart Notes showing linkannotations.&quot;&gt;I&rsquo;ve only experimented with this a little, but I find that navigation iseasier. My hope is that short &ldquo;linking phrases&rdquo; (inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map\">conceptmapping</a>) will be enough to annotatelinks.## Closing thoughtsWith annotated links added, I think Smart Notes is pretty flexible. First ofall you can create arbitrary tree-like structures that can mimic the structureyou get from folgezettel without having to deal with a complicated numberingscheme. That structure can give you a bird&rsquo;s eye view that Bob talks about. Ifyou don&rsquo;t want to emphasize a tree structure, you can use annotated links tolink arbitrarily and make the context of the connections clear.I try to make Smart Notes a digital note taking application that followsprinciples from the Zettelkasten method. Sometimes it is easy to focus on thespecifics of the method and try to replicate it as closely as possible. But Ithink it is more important to experiment and see what works. Smart Notes hasbeen my way of exploring Zettelkasten, and I will continue to tweak it as Ilearn, both from reading and researching, and from practicing. Mostimportantly, I will try to use my notes for creative output and learning andtry to notice what features in Smart Notes maximize that.</p>\n",
