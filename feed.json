				"content_html": "<p>Normally I do something related to programming in my spare time every month. I\nread something that I find interesting and want to share. Or I have some\nthought related to programming that I want to share. This is the first month\nsince I started these monthly updates in June 2019 that I&rsquo;ve got nothing of\nthat. I&rsquo;ve been occupied with other things, and I&rsquo;ve also done quite a bit of\nprogramming at work. Perhaps that has satisfied my interest for programming.</p>\n<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve done a lot at work this month is wrapping simple data\nstructures in classes. Instead of passing around lists and dictionaries, I&rsquo;ve\ncreated classes holding that data and only serialized it at the edges of the\napplication. Every time I have done this, I wish I had done it sooner. It&rsquo;s so\ngood. And in nine times out of ten, those classes have attracted some\nfunctionality that fits perfectly. They have provided one place to put\nfunctionality instead of scattering it throughout the codebase.</p>\n<p>What am I talking about? Let me give an example.</p>\n<p>Imagine that we talk to a user service that has an API something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\">service<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>get_all_users() <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-&gt;</span> [<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;user1&#34;</span>, <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;user2&#34;</span>]\nservice<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>set_users_in_group(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;group1&#34;</span>, [<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;user1&#34;</span>, <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;user2&#34;</span>]) <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-&gt;</span> OK\n</code></pre></div><p>The API works with users represented as list of strings. Now we want to write a\nfunction that applies some domain logic to assign users to groups. It is so\neasy and tempting to write something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">def</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">update_r_users</span>(service)\n    r_users <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> []\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">for</span> user <span style=\"color:#f92672\">in</span> service<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>get_all_users():\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;r&#34;</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">in</span> user:\n            r_users<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>append(user)\n    service<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>set_users_in_group(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;users_with_r_in_name&#34;</span>, r_users)\n</code></pre></div><p>One problem with this code is that it mixes calls to the user service with\ndomain logic, so is is difficult to test domain logic without invoking the\nservice.

				"content_html": "<p>This month I read <a href=\"https://www.kathleenspracklen.com/zettelkasten-emotion\">How to Use a Zettelkasten to Write Stories Packed with\nEmotion</a>. It inspired\nme to write something using that technique. The topic that came to mind was\nBash redirects. It resulted in the blog post <a href=\"https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/09/04/bash-redirects-explained.html\">Bash Redirects\nExplained</a>.</p>\n<p>I also started reading <em>How Children Learn</em> by John Holt. He says that children\nare naturally interested in exploring the world. I started thinking about what\nenvironments kill exploration. I though that fear of doing something wrong will\ndiscourage exploration. Then I made a parallel to a common practice in software\ndevelopment: pull requests. I thought that pull requests discourage experiments\nbecause changes can only propagate after approval, and the idea behind pull\nrequests is to only approve &ldquo;good&rdquo; changes. First of all, the learning\nopportunities of mistakes are gone. Second of all, you might loose interest in\nexperimenting because you are afraid of making a mistake. You build a culture\nof discouraging making mistakes.

				"content_text": "This month I read [How to Use a Zettelkasten to Write Stories Packed with\r\nEmotion](https://www.kathleenspracklen.com/zettelkasten-emotion). It inspired\r\nme to write something using that technique. The topic that came to mind was\r\nBash redirects. It resulted in the blog post [Bash Redirects\r\nExplained](https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/09/04/bash-redirects-explained.html).\r\n\r\nI also started reading *How Children Learn* by John Holt. He says that children\r\nare naturally interested in exploring the world. I started thinking about what\r\nenvironments kill exploration. I though that fear of doing something wrong will\r\ndiscourage exploration. Then I made a parallel to a common practice in software\r\ndevelopment: pull requests. I thought that pull requests discourage experiments\r\nbecause changes can only propagate after approval, and the idea behind pull\r\nrequests is to only approve \"good\" changes. First of all, the learning\r\nopportunities of mistakes are gone. Second of all, you might loose interest in\r\nexperimenting because you are afraid of making a mistake. You build a culture\r\nof discouraging making mistakes.

I can easily parse any\nsituation and use any combination of redirects for my purposes.</p>\n<p>The rest of this article explains this mental model.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-standard-streams\">The Standard Streams</h2>\n<p>A process has three standard streams attached to it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stdin (0)</li>\n<li>stdout (1)</li>\n<li>stderr (2)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>When we start a program from the terminal, Bash sets up the standard streams as\nfollows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stdin: terminal/keyboard</li>\n<li>stdout: terminal</li>\n<li>stderr: terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What redirects do is to modify what the standard streams point to before the\nprogram starts executing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;</code> means modify stdin.</li>\n<li><code>&gt;</code> means modify stdout.</li>\n<li><code>2&gt;</code> means modify stderr.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is the mental model: <strong>redirects modify standard streams before program\nexecution</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s evaluate a few examples using this mental model to see how it works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"logcat-utility\">Logcat Utility</h2>\n<p>To be able to show what happens in different examples, we have a utility\nprogram, <code>logcat.py</code>, that makes use of all three streams. It reads text from\nstdin, logs the arguments and the length of the text to stderr, and writes the\ntext to stdout. It looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span style=\"color:#75715e\">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:#f92672\">import</span> sys\n\ntext <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> sys<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>stdin<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>read()\n\nsys<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>stderr<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>write(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">f</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Args: </span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">{</span>(sys<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>argv[<span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">1</span>:])<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">}</span><span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">\\n</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;</span>)\nsys<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>stderr<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>write(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">f</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Read </span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">{</span>len(text)<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">}</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\"> characters.</span><span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">\\n</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;</span>)\n\nsys<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>stdout<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>write(text)\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"example-no-redirect\">Example: No Redirect</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an example without redirects to see the operation of\n<code>logcat.py</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">$ ./logcat.py ignored arguments\n</code></pre></div><p>Before <code>logcat.py</code> starts executing, Bash sets up the standard streams as\nfollows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stdin: terminal/keyboard</li>\n<li>stdout: terminal</li>\n<li>stderr: terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When execution starts, <code>logcat.py</code> waits for input. If we type <code>hello</code> in the\nterminal (followed by a return and ctrl+d), the following is printed to the\nterminal:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">Args: [&#39;ignored&#39;, &#39;arguments&#39;]\nRead 6 characters.\nhello\n</code></pre></div><p>We can see that it read our input from the terminal/keyboard and wrote the log\nmessages along with our input to the terminal as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-redirect-stdin\">Example: Redirect Stdin</h2>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s modify stdin to instead of the terminal/keyboard be the <code>logcat.py</code>\nsource code:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">$ ./logcat.py ignored arguments &lt;logcat.py\n</code></pre></div><p>This instructs Bash to modify stdin to point to the file <code>logcat.py</code>.</p>\n<p>Before <code>logcat.py</code> starts executing, Bash sets up the standard streams as\nfollows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>\n<li>stdout: terminal</li>\n<li>stderr: terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When execution starts, the following is printed to the terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">Args: [&#39;ignored&#39;, &#39;arguments&#39;]\nRead 182 characters.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport sys\n\ntext = sys.stdin.read()\n\nsys.stderr.write(f&#34;Args: {(sys.argv[1:])}\\n&#34;)\nsys.stderr.write(f&#34;Read {len(text)} characters.\\n&#34;)\n\nsys.stdout.write(text)\n</code></pre></div><p>We can see that the redirect operation is stripped from the arguments.

Before it starts executing the program with the arguments, it goes\nthrough the redirects, in order, and configures the standard streams before\nexecution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-redirect-all-streams\">Example: Redirect All Streams</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how we can interpret a more complex command using the extended mental\nmodel:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">$ ./logcat.py &lt;logcat.py is the &gt;out.txt best 2&gt;&amp;1 thing\n</code></pre></div><p>If we split this into arguments and redirects, we get this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arguments: <code>./logcat.py</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>the</code>, <code>best</code>, <code>thing</code></li>\n<li>Redirects: <code>&lt;logcat.py</code>, <code>&gt;out.txt</code>, <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s evaluate the redirects in order. The state of the standard streams\nat start is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stdin: terminal/keyboard</li>\n<li>stdout: terminal</li>\n<li>stderr: terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then we evaluate <code>&lt;logcat.py</code> and get this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>\n<li>stdout: terminal</li>\n<li>stderr: terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then we evaluate <code>&gt;out.txt</code> and get this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>\n<li>stdout: <code>out.txt</code> (opened in write mode)</li>\n<li>stderr: terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then we evaluate <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code>, which means modify stderr (<code>2&gt;</code>) to be whatever\nstdout points to (<code>&amp;1</code>), and get this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stdin: <code>logcat.py</code> (opened in read mode)</li>\n<li>stdout: <code>out.txt</code> (opened in write mode)</li>\n<li>stderr: <code>out.txt</code> (opened in write mode)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the standard streams have been set up, execution of <code>./logcat.py is the best thing</code> starts.

				"content_text": "I thought I knew how Bash redirects worked.\n\nIf I wanted to redirect the output of a command to a file, I'd type this:\n\n```bash\nprogram > /tmp/log.txt\n```\nIf I wanted to pipe both stdout and stderr to a text editor for further\nprocessing, I'd type this:\n\n```bash\nprogram 2>&1 | vim -\n```\nI knew that `2>&1` meant redirect stderr to stdout making it appear on stdout\nas well.\n\nI knew certain patterns for certain situations. But when I encountered\nsituations where I had not learned a pattern, I was lost. For example, I could\nnot explain the difference between\n\n```bash\nprogram 2>&1 >/tmp/log.txt\n```\nand\n\n```bash\nprogram >/tmp/log.txt 2>&1\n```\nAnd I got scared when I saw something like this:\n\n```bash\nprogram < input.txt > output.txt 2>&1\n```\nHave you also been there? What did you do?\n\nI would search the Internet for a pattern that matched the use case, or just\ntry different alternatives and notice how they behaved.\n\nI did this until one day when I learned a mental model for how Bash redirects\nwork. Now I no longer need to rely on patterns. I can easily parse any\nsituation and use any combination of redirects for my purposes.\n\nThe rest of this article explains this mental model.\n\n## The Standard Streams\n\nA process has three standard streams attached to it:\n\n* stdin (0)\n* stdout (1)\n* stderr (2)\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/process-streams.png\"\nwidth=\"600\" height=\"227\" alt=\"Diagram of the three streams of a process.\">\n\nWhen we start a program from the terminal, Bash sets up the standard streams as\nfollows:\n\n* stdin: terminal/keyboard\n* stdout: terminal\n* stderr: terminal\n\nWhat redirects do is to modify what the standard streams point to before the\nprogram starts executing.\n\n* `<` means modify stdin.\n* `>` means modify stdout.\n* `2>` means modify stderr.\n\nThat is the mental model: **redirects modify standard streams before program\nexecution**.\n\nLet's evaluate a few examples using this mental model to see how it works.\n\n## Logcat Utility\n\nTo be able to show what happens in different examples, we have a utility\nprogram, `logcat.py`, that makes use of all three streams. It reads text from\nstdin, logs the arguments and the length of the text to stderr, and writes the\ntext to stdout. It looks like this:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport sys\n\ntext = sys.stdin.read()\n\nsys.stderr.write(f\"Args: {(sys.argv[1:])}\\n\")\nsys.stderr.write(f\"Read {len(text)} characters.\\n\")\n\nsys.stdout.write(text)\n```\n## Example: No Redirect\n\nLet's start with an example without redirects to see the operation of\n`logcat.py`:\n\n```text\n$ ./logcat.py ignored arguments\n```\nBefore `logcat.py` starts executing, Bash sets up the standard streams as\nfollows:\n\n* stdin: terminal/keyboard\n* stdout: terminal\n* stderr: terminal\n\nWhen execution starts, `logcat.py` waits for input. If we type `hello` in the\nterminal (followed by a return and ctrl+d), the following is printed to the\nterminal:\n\n```text\nArgs: ['ignored', 'arguments']\nRead 6 characters.\nhello\n```\nWe can see that it read our input from the terminal/keyboard and wrote the log\nmessages along with our input to the terminal as well.\n\n## Example: Redirect Stdin\n\nNow let's modify stdin to instead of the terminal/keyboard be the `logcat.py`\nsource code:\n\n```text\n$ ./logcat.py ignored arguments <logcat.py\n```\nThis instructs Bash to modify stdin to point to the file `logcat.py`.\n\nBefore `logcat.py` starts executing, Bash sets up the standard streams as\nfollows:\n\n* stdin: `logcat.py` (opened in read mode)\n* stdout: terminal\n* stderr: terminal\n\nWhen execution starts, the following is printed to the terminal:\n\n```text\nArgs: ['ignored', 'arguments']\nRead 182 characters.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport sys\n\ntext = sys.stdin.read()\n\nsys.stderr.write(f\"Args: {(sys.argv[1:])}\\n\")\nsys.stderr.write(f\"Read {len(text)} characters.\\n\")\n\nsys.stdout.write(text)\n```\nWe can see that the redirect operation is stripped from the arguments. Only\nBash sees it and does not pass it along to the program. Furthermore we can see\nthat the `logcat.py` source code is printed to the terminal.\n\n## Example: Redirect Stdin and Stdout\n\nLet's say we're only interested in the log messages, and want to throw away\nstdout:\n\n```text\n$ ./logcat.py ignored arguments <logcat.py >/dev/null\n```\nThis instructs Bash to modify stdin to point to the file `logcat.py` and to\nmodify stdout to point to the file `/dev/null`.\n\nBefore `logcat.py` starts executing, Bash sets up the standard streams as\nfollows:\n\n* stdin: `logcat.py` (opened in read mode)\n* stdout: `/dev/null` (opened in write mode)\n* stderr: terminal\n\nWhen execution starts, the following is printed to the terminal:\n\n```text\nArgs: ['ignored', 'arguments']\nRead 182 characters.\n```\nWe can see that the redirect operations are all stripped from the arguments and\nthe source code has been written to `/dev/null` and is thus not shown in the\nterminal.\n\n## Extended Mental Model\n\nLet's extended the mental model to clarify how Bash operates.\n\nWhen Bash parses a command, it divides it into two parts: the arguments and the\nredirects. Before it starts executing the program with the arguments, it goes\nthrough the redirects, in order, and configures the standard streams before\nexecution.\n\n## Example: Redirect All Streams\n\nLet's see how we can interpret a more complex command using the extended mental\nmodel:\n\n```text\n$ ./logcat.py <logcat.py is the >out.txt best 2>&1 thing\n```\nIf we split this into arguments and redirects, we get this:\n\n* Arguments: `./logcat.py`, `is`, `the`, `best`, `thing`\n* Redirects: `<logcat.py`, `>out.txt`, `2>&1`\n\nNow, let's evaluate the redirects in order. The state of the standard streams\nat start is this:\n\n* stdin: terminal/keyboard\n* stdout: terminal\n* stderr: terminal\n\nThen we evaluate `<logcat.py` and get this:\n\n* stdin: `logcat.py` (opened in read mode)\n* stdout: terminal\n* stderr: terminal\n\nThen we evaluate `>out.txt` and get this:\n\n* stdin: `logcat.py` (opened in read mode)\n* stdout: `out.txt` (opened in write mode)\n* stderr: terminal\n\nThen we evaluate `2>&1`, which means modify stderr (`2>`) to be whatever\nstdout points to (`&1`), and get this:\n\n* stdin: `logcat.py` (opened in read mode)\n* stdout: `out.txt` (opened in write mode)\n* stderr: `out.txt` (opened in write mode)\n\nAfter the standard streams have been set up, execution of `./logcat.py is the\nbest thing` starts. Nothing appears on the terminal since all output has been\nredirected to `out.txt`:\n\n```text\n$ cat out.txt\nArgs: ['is', 'the', 'best', 'thing']\nRead 182 characters.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport sys\n\ntext = sys.stdin.read()\n\nsys.stderr.write(f\"Args: {(sys.argv[1:])}\\n\")\nsys.stderr.write(f\"Read {len(text)} characters.\\n\")\n\nsys.stdout.write(text)\n```\n## Mini Shell\n\nI created a mini version of a shell to demonstrate how straight forward it is\nto implement redirects with POSIX system calls. It works exactly as the\nextended mental model, and because it is running software, it fills in some\nmore details of the model. I would guess that Bash does something similar even\nthough I haven't read its source code.\n\nFirst off, here is a demo that shows how the mini shell can replicate the\ncomplex example from above:\n\n```text\n$ ./minishell.py\n~~?~~> ./logcat.py <logcat.py is the >out.txt best 2>&1 thing\n~~0~~> cat out.txt\nArgs: ['is', 'the', 'best', 'thing']\nRead 182 characters.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport sys\n\ntext = sys.stdin.read()\n\nsys.stderr.write(f\"Args: {(sys.argv[1:])}\\n\")\nsys.stderr.write(f\"Read {len(text)} characters.\\n\")\n\nsys.stdout.write(text)\n```\nAnd here is the implementation in only 31 lines of Python:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nSTDIN  = 0\nSTDOUT = 1\nSTDERR = 2\n\nstatuscode = \"?\"\nwhile True:\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"~~{statuscode}~~> \")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    command = input()\n    pid = os.fork()\n    if pid == 0:\n        args = []\n        for part in command.split(\" \"):\n            if part.startswith(\"<\"):\n                os.dup2(os.open(part[1:], os.O_RDONLY), STDIN)\n            elif part.startswith(\">\"):\n                os.dup2(os.open(part[1:], os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREAT, 0o644), STDOUT)\n            elif part == \"2>&1\":\n                os.dup2(STDOUT, STDERR)\n            elif part.startswith(\"2>\"):\n                os.dup2(os.open(part[2:], os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREAT, 0o644), STDERR)\n            else:\n                args.append(part)\n        os.execvp(args[0], args)\n    else:\n        _, statuscode = os.waitpid(pid, 0)\n```\nTo understand how this works, you need some knowledge of the POSIX system calls\n`fork`, `waitpid`, `open`, `dup2`, and `execvp`. But even if you don't\nunderstand the specifics, I think this codified model can help in understanding\nhow Bash operates. Let's look at an example.\n\n## Example: Duplicated Files\n\nLet's see if we can explain the difference between the following commands using\nthe mini shell for the model:\n\n```text\n$ ./logcat.py <logcat.py >out.txt 2>out.txt\n$ ./logcat.py <logcat.py >out.txt 2>&1\n```\nAt a first glance, it looks like both commands redirect both stdout and stderr\nto the `out.txt` file. But if we evaluate it like mini shell does, we see that\nthe first example will open the file twice (two calls to `os.open` creating two\nfile handles), whereas the second example will open the file only once and then\nduplicate the file handle for stderr.\n\nWhen two file handles are created, writes to the two streams will attempt to\nwrite to the same location in the file and they will overwrite each other.\nFurthermore, buffering might alter in which order writes happen, so it is not\nclear what will actually end up in the file. So to make sure all output is\ncaptured in the file, the second example should be used where the file is only\nopened once.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is still more to Bash redirects than what I have explained here. But this\nmental model (along with its extended versions) have helped me reason about\nBash redirects. I hope it will do the same for you.\n\n",

				"content_text": "In August I had my last week of summer vacation. I read a book that made me\r\nwant to improve my note taking tool, I did some programming on hobby projects,\r\nand I migrated my blog to a new platform. All while doing many runs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/collage-202408.png\"\r\nwidth=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Collage of activities in August.\">\r\n\r\n## A System for Writing\r\n\r\nI read *A System for Writing* by Bob Doto. [This\r\nreview](http://richardcarter.com/reviews/book-review-a-system-for-writing-by-bob-doto/)\r\nis what made me buy the book:\r\n\r\n> When I first tried to get my head around Zettelkasten, I consulted Sönke\r\n> Ahrens’ extremely useful book How to Take Smart Notes. This was—and still\r\n> is—seen as the book to read on the subject. I predict A System for Writing\r\n> will replace it.\r\n\r\nI liked Sönke's book, and I was curious to learn more about this topic from a\r\nsource that seemed credible.\r\n\r\nI got some new insights about the Zettelkasten method. In particular the idea\r\nthat it is important to articulate how two ideas relate. I've previously mostly\r\nconnected ideas without context. The connection was obvious when I made it,\r\nbut most likely less obvious when I come back to it.\r\n\r\nI tried to research this a bit more and found the article [Backlinking Is Not\r\nVery Useful -- Often Even\r\nHarmful](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/):\r\n\r\n> A good link context explains what you can expect if you follow the link. But\r\n> it can also explain the nature of the relationship between both notes.\r\n\r\nI wanted to try this out.\r\n\r\n## Smart Notes\r\n\r\nI use my [Smart Notes](https://rickardlindberg.me/categories/smart-notes) app\r\nto take notes using the Zettelkasten method. When I studied the method more, I\r\ngot some new ideas that I implemented:\r\n\r\n* I configured different note types to show in different colors. Zettelkasten\r\n  has a few different kinds of notes, and quickly being able to see, by color,\r\n  which it is, has been helpful.\r\n\r\n* I added the ability to change the order of notes. This was needed to be able\r\n  to create structure notes with links in specific order.\r\n\r\n* I added the ability to give [links a text\r\n  description](https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/08/11/i-just-implemented.html).\r\n  This is what allowed me to experiment with articulating how two ideas relate\r\n  to each other. I wrote more about the evolution of this feature in [Linking\r\n  (and how it has evolved) in Smart\r\n  Notes](https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/08/29/linking-and-how.html).\r\n\r\n## One-File Programs\r\n\r\nI continued to work on [One-File\r\nPrograms](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/one-file-programs).\r\n\r\nI worked on an engine app that can automatically reload other apps when they\r\nchange. This gives faster feedback, especially when working on graphical\r\napplications. It is similar to an approach I've written about previously in\r\n[How to get fast feedback on graphical\r\ncode?](https://rickardlindberg.me/2023/07/28/how-to-get.html)\r\n\r\nI also worked on the [no\r\nscrollbars](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/one-file-programs/tree/master/no-scrollbars)\r\napp. I wanted to see if we can get rid of scrollbars in some GUI elements. The\r\nidea is to make items larger around the area of the mouse so that they can more\r\neasily get selected. Here is one screenshot:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/no-scrollbars.png\"\r\nwidth=\"600\" height=\"312\" alt=\"Screenshot of no scrollbars experiment.\">\r\n\r\nI want do continue work with this repo, but the rest of the time this month, I\r\nspent on my blog.\r\n\r\n## Micro.blog\r\n\r\nI [found out about\r\nMicro.blog](https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/08/11/how-i-found.html) and moved\r\nmy blog to it.\r\n\r\n* I documented how I did a redirect to my old archived site for pages that I\r\n  have not yet migrated to the new blog in [Poor man's redirect in a static\r\n  site](https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/08/09/poor-mans-redirect.html).\r\n\r\n* I started a \"photo blog\" documenting my\r\n  [runs](https://rickardlindberg.me/categories/running/) and how my life\r\n  improves from them.\r\n\r\nSome reflections on Micro.blog:\r\n\r\n* Micro.blog makes it easy to create [a website that feels like a\r\n  home](https://nicochilla.com/my-website-as-a-home/).\r\n\r\n  I can share and develop my interests. I can structure content with categories\r\n  and pages. Others can come have a look. Comment if they wish. And you can\r\n  see conversations that I've had with visitors.\r\n\r\n* It makes blogging fun. It is easy to publish and you can get comments from\r\n  the community on your posts.\r\n\r\n",

Notes related to\neach other can form a train of thought, and reviewing that train of though is\nuseful. In a physical Zettelkasten related notes are stored close to each\nother, and following a train of though can be done by flipping through the\ncards in an area.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about how this aspect of Zettelkasten could be realized in Smart\nNotes.</p>\n<p>I read more about how notes are stored and numbered in a physical Zettelkasten.\nThere seems to be two cases. Either the note is related to an existing note, in\nwhich case it is put right behind it, or the note is not related to any\nexisting notes, in which case it is put at the end.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if a note is related to an existing note, a distinction seems to\nbe made if the new note continues the train of though of the previous note or\nif it branches off. With the Zettelkasten numbering system, it might be\npossible to distinguish these different cases. In <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/\">Introduction to the\nZettelkasten Method</a>, Sascha writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The very first note is assigned the number 1. If you add a second note that\nis not related to the first note, it is assigned the number 2. But if you\nwant to continue the first note, or inject something into its content,\ncomment on it, or something along those lines, you branch off. That new note\nwould get assigned the number 1a. If you continue with this new note, you\nwould go on with 1b. If you then want to comment on the note 1a, you would\ncreate a note with the address 1a1. So, in short, whenever you continue a\ntrain of thought, you increment the last position in the address, be it\nnumber or a character from the alphabet. And when you want to expand,\nintersperse, or comment on a note, you take its address and append a new\ncharacter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Smart Note lacks any visible note ids. So I was thinking that I might be\nmissing out on something. What types of hierarchies are created with the\nnumbering scheme in Zettelkasten? Can I already replicate those hierarchies in\nSmart Notes?</p>\n<h2 id=\"folgezettel\">Folgezettel</h2>\n<p>There seems to be a debate going on whether the numbering scheme in\nZettelkasten, sometimes called &ldquo;folgezettel&rdquo; is useful or not.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/\">No, Luhmann was not about\nFolgezettel</a>, Sascha\nargues that the kind of links created with folgezettel are weak. We know that\nthere is a relationship between two notes, but we don&rsquo;t know what that\nrelationship is. Sascha further acknowledges that the folgezettel technique is\nprobably more practically useful in a physical Zettelkasten, but in a digital\nworld, creating annotated links is a better solution. (Creating annotated links\nis certainly possible in a physical Zettelkasten, but browsing those links\nwould be tedious because the note in the link might be in a totally different\nplace in the slip-box.)</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://writing.bobdoto.computer/folgezettel-is-more-than-mechanism/\">Folgezettel is More than\nMechanism</a>,\nBob argues that the folgezettel technique is useful even in a digital world.\nOne point is that it allows you to get a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the topics and\nthreads that are developing in your Zettelkasten.
